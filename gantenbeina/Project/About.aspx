A spectre is haunting Europe — the spectre of communism. All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre: Pope and Tsar, Metternich and Guizot, French Radicals and German police-spies.

Where is the party in opposition that has not been decried as communistic by its opponents in power? Where is the opposition that has not hurled back the branding reproach of communism, against the more advanced opposition parties, as well as against its reactionary adversaries?                </p>

                    I was minding my own business yesterday when I realized I hadn’t seen a Chevy commercial in over 10 minutes. Right as the thought entered my head, the clipboard guy appeared on screen. “THESE ARE REAL PEOPLE” the commercial says. He begins to speak. “What truck brand comes from the family of the most dependable, longest-lasting full sized pickups on the road?” I knew the answer. Chevy. Fucking Chevrolet.
