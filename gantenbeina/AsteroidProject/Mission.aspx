            Our mission objective is to mine on 3 different type of asteroids. The purpose of mining is to determine if it is worth the money to mine resources on asteroids (specifically jewels). The asteroids we chose are Vesta, Eunomia, and Pallas. We chose these because they are known to have a metal rich surface for making the expedition out the asteroid worth it. We will be sending a team of 5 to mine on the surfaces of each asteroid. There will be three different types of mining process used magnetic rakes, shaft mining, and self-replicating machines. More information will be found on there corresponding web pages.
