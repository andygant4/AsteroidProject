                Self-Replicating mining would entail using large 3D-printers to produce the majority of supplies on site. The goal is to produce 80% of required equipment on the asteroid; while importing more sensitive parts from Earth. The 3D-printers would use the onsite materials to produce a filament. Once the process of filament production is automated, the costs required to mine are reduced significantly. In the long-term, self-replicating mining allows the company to branch into other industries. The most lucrative would be to search for alternative fuel sources.

                This idea is still highly theoretical and would require an initial trip to gather soil. Once back on earth, scientist would have to create a process to make “filament”. It would likely take over a decade to reach the point where filament is easily produced and passes quality control. Lastly, like concrete, a filament mix has to be sent to the asteroids for production. This would increase the frequency of launches, but reduce the weight of the launches.
