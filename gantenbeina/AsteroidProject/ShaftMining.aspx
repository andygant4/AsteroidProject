                <br />
                <p >
                Shaft mining is where you have an elavator at the top of the surface that lowers you into the asteroid, where we will have to mine out tunnels to mine the ore for the mission.
                We chose shaft mining, since most of the mining we will be doing is inside the Asteroid. We will do this by creating a central hub base on the asteroid, connected to a central
                shaft to go inside the Asteroid. Since there will be no oxygen inside the Asteroid. To be able to mine we will send humans down the shaft in space suits. They will then physically
                mine until air in tank gets low. The central shaft will be vacumed sealed so there will be air allowing you to be able to move easly. There will be many problems that will happen for this to work.

                <br />
                Since this will be in and on the Asteroid Belt, we will run into problems of other asteroid hitting the one we are currently mining on. We also will have the problem with food and air, since we are so far away we will need to monitor our resources so we do not run out before we get back.
