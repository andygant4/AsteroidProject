                Magnetic raking is the process of raking a surface in order to attract metallic objects on the surface. The rakes would be ideally attached to rovers that could drag them across the surface of the asteroid.
                The rovers could be driven by humans or be remotely controlled. The magnetic raking mission would start by sending a few rovers with rakes attached to them. Once their rakes are full on material, they would 
                need to be retrieved by another vehicle and taken to a central location. Once their would be enough material collected, a ship would launch back to earth with all of the collected material and rovers.

                Since this will be in and on the Asteroid Belt, we will run into problems of other asteroid hitting the one we are currently raking on. Another issue would be the surface composition would need to be very soft in order for the rakes to pick them up. 
                Another one of the issues would be the mass of all the material
                that would be collected from raking. There would need to be someone to supervise the robotic raking in order to troubleshoot any asteroid related problems, no matter how many vehicles are on the asteroid. Also, depending on how many rovers are sent and
                how big the asteroid is, the raking mission could take a very long time to completed, as some of the larger asteroids like Vesta are larger than our moon.
